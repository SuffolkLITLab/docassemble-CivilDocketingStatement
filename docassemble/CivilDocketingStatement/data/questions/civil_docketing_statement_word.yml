id: interlocutory_basis
question: |
  
  Please list the law, statute, court rule, or legal doctrine that allows you to file an appeal before the case is final, for example, G.L. c. 231, § 118 (first paragraph) or the doctrine of present execution.

subquestion: |
  G.L. c. 231, § 118 (first paragraph) is a Massachusetts statute that allows a party to seek review of certain interlocutory (non-final) orders issued by a trial court judge.

  Here are common examples of orders that may qualify under the doctrine of present execution in Massachusetts (meaning they can sometimes be appealed immediately, even though the case is not over):

  • Denial of a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity
  • Denial of qualified immunity for a public official
  • Denial of absolute immunity (such as prosecutorial immunity)
  • Orders compelling disclosure of privileged information (for example, attorney–client privilege)
  • Orders denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy
  • Certain rulings affecting constitutional rights that would be lost if review waited until final judgment
  • Orders denying protection under the anti-SLAPP statute
  • Orders denying a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (in some circumstances)
